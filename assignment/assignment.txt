This assignment will be part of your grade. It should be completed during the workshop. If not, please complete it and send it back before Wednesday, January the 5th - 9am.

Follow the steps and answer the questions. 

To get a full mark, add the code or command used to find the answer. 


1/ Get the documents prepared for the workshop. They are available on GitHub at https://github.com/tmaroilley/Linux_Course. Unzip the archive if necessary.
	
2/ Go to Linux_Course/data
	QUESTION #1: List all the files present in Linux_Course/data and file sizes

3/ Create a directory Linux_Course/work

4/ Go into Linux_Course/work

5/ Copy in Linux/work the file Linux_Course/data/mart_export.txt
	QUESTION #2: How many lines are in Linux_Course/data/mart_export.txt?

	QUESTION #3: What is the size of mart_export.txt? 

6/ Compress mart_export.txt
	QUESTION #4: What is the size of the archive obtained?

7/ Extract the file from the archive. You should get the file mart_export.txt back. Check the size again. 

8/ In Linux/work: Change the name of mart_export.txt in data.tsv
	QUESTION #5: Copy here the 20 last lines of data.tsv

9/ Output the 4th element of each line (or 4th column of the file) and redirect the output into a file called fourth_column.txt
	QUESTION #6: Copy here the first 5 lines of fourth_column.txt

10/ Extract the lines that contains "N-acetylgalactosaminide".
	QUESTION #7: How many lines contain the term "N-acetylgalactosaminide"?

11/ Sort your file and redirect to output into a new file called data_sorted.tsv. Check if the size of the file and the number of lines are the same as data.tsv.

12/ Select the first 15 lines of data_sorted.txt and redirect the output into a new file called fifteen_lines.txt

13/ Compare data_sorted.txt and fifteen_lines.txt. Print only the common lines.
	QUESTION #8: How many lines are only present in data_sorted.txt?

14/ In data.tsv, the fifth column in the chromosome on which the gene is mapped. 
	QUESTION #9: Using the option "-c" of the "uniq" command, how many genes are on chromosome 3? (Tip: uniq only worked properly if the data are sorted first)

15/ From data.tsv, extract the lines containing information on genes for which the GC content is >50% (column #3), then select only the gene name, chromosom, start and end positions and gene description (colunms 2,5,6,7,8). Replace "[" and "]" by "_".
	QUESTION #10: Print here the first 6 lines of the output.
